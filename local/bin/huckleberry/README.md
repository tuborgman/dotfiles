# Huckleberry

Huckleberry is a barebones command-line client for [Fin](https://getfin.com).
Just run `huckleberry 'Do the things'` and Fin'll get 'em done (and, unlike
emailing your request in, you'll see requests made through Huckleberry in the
app).

## Usage

Using Huckleberry is as simple as it gets. Take the script in
[`bin/huckleberry`](bin/huckleberry) and put it somewhere in your `PATH`.

Once you've done that, set `FIN_TOKEN` to your Fin token in your `.bashrc` (I
personally have a `~/.finrc` file that's sourced by `~/.bashrc` when launched).
You can get your Fin token by proxying requests while the Fin app is open
through something like [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/).

Now just run `huckleberry` followed by your request to Fin. Finntastic! (please
excuse the bad pun)

```
Usage: huckleberry [request]

Examples:

  $ huckleberry 'How old is Barack Obama?'
  $ huckleberry 'How many miles is NYC from SF?'
  $ huckleberry 'What is the wait for two at Ippudo Westside?'
```

## API Docs

This contains (very) preliminary documentation for Fin's API, primarily for
personal reference.

You should use this user agent, but it's not required: `Fin/3.1.1 (iPhone; iOS
9.2.1; Scale/2.00)`
